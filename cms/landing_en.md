#Rijksmuseum API
##The Rijksmuseum API (Application Programming Interface) is a new, state-of-the-art service for application developers. The Rijksmuseum offers the API to make its collection (as well as other content and high resolution images) available for use in apps or web applications, for example.
###API
The live website API (which has a live link to the website platform) makes the full power of the award-winning Rijksmuseum website directly accessible to a large group of developers. Searching the collection is one activity that offers a wide range of interesting options. The same is true of the “explore the collection” pages, the Rijksstudio users’ collections, and the tiled images used to zoom in to tight close-ups of works of art. Calendar information is also available, for example.
The JSON-based service is so simple that, in no time at all, you can build something that makes use of the Rijksmuseum’s rich and attractive content.

###Access to the API
You will first need to request an API key, to access the data and images. You can do this via the advanced settings of your Rijksstudio account ([www.rijksmuseum.nl/rijksstudio](http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/rijksstudio)). You will then immediately be given a code. You will need this code to use the APIs.

###OAI API
Since 2011, the Rijksmuseum has also offered an API with the OAI (Open Achives Initiative) protocol. In the cultural sector, OAI is a standard that is mainly used by organizations such as Europeana, the National Library of the Netherlands and the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision.

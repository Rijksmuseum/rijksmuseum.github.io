#Rijksmuseum API
##The Rijksmuseum API (Application Programming Interface) is a state-of-the-art service for application developers. The Rijksmuseum offers the API to make its collection (as well as other content and high resolution images) available for use in apps or web applications, for example.
###API
The live website API (which has a live link to the website platform) makes the full power of the award-winning Rijksmuseum website directly accessible to developers. Searching the collection through the API offers a wide range of interesting possibilities, as do features such as the “explore the collection” pages, the Rijksstudio users’ collections, and the tiled images used to zoom in to close-ups of works of art. Other kinds of data are also available, such as information from the Rijksmuseum's events calendar. The JSON-based service is so easy to use that you can create an application using the Rijksmuseum’s rich and freely accessible content in no time.

###OAI API
Since 2011, the Rijksmuseum also offers an API featuring the [OAI-PMH protocol](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting). The OAI-PMH standard is widely used in the cultural heritage sector to support harvesting metadata of collections. The Rijksmuseum OAI-PMH API provides access to more than 600,000 descriptions of objects (metadata) and digital images from the Rijksmuseum collection and this number is still growing.

###Using the API's
In order to access the possibilities the API's have to offer you need to have an API key. This personal code can be obtained through the advanced settings of your [Rijksstudio user account](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/my/profile). You will be provided with your API key instantly upon request. The API documentation on Github explains how to use the key. Using the Rijksmuseum's API's is subject to a set of [terms and conditions](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api/terms-and-conditions-of-use).
